# Response to reviews: Variable pneumatic features in the ribs of _Brachiosaurus altithorax_

Michael P. Taylor and Mathew J. Wedel


## Overview

First of all, we are genuinely grateful to all three reviewers for their helpful and generous reviewers. This experience has been a rare and very welcome one of every reviewer's goal being to improve the manuscript.

We have in general accepted the recommendations of the reviewers. In the remainder of this document, we describe the relatively few points where we have elected not to do so.


## Review 1 - Jerry Harris:

We have added some further brief material to the introduction as suggested, but in general prefer short introductions that allow the abbreviations to be near the start of a paper.

> The only aspect of the manuscript that puzzled me a bit was a peculiar over-division into many paragraphs

In some cases, we have followed Jerry's advice to join consecutive paragraphs. In others, however, we have kept paragraphs separate, following the approach that paragraphs have no ideal length to aim for but are units of thought. For example, the paragraph beginning "As with pneumatic features in other bones, it is likely that the excavation of ribs by diverticula of the pulmonary system followed paths laid down by blood vessels" introduces a new idea, and so is rightly presented in its own paragraph.
