Variable pneumatic features in the ribs of Brachiosaurus altithorax

Dear Dr Taylor,

I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript, entitled: Variable pneumatic features in the ribs of Brachiosaurus altithorax, might be accepted for publication in our journal, pending some minor changes.

Please revise your paper strictly according to the attached Reviewers' comments. Your manuscript won't be taken into consideration without the revisions made according to the reviewers as well as editorial recommendations.

Authors of our journal are requested to prepare a revised version of their manuscript as soon as possible. This may ensure fast publication if an article is finally accepted.

If you haven't uploaded high resolution figures prepared accordingly to instruction for authors https://e-system.app.pan.pl/app/journal/for_authors/#id4, please send them with the revised version of the manuscript. If you choose colour pdf and black and white figures in print, prepare separate figures ensuring proper quality (simple conversion to grey scale may lead to waste of readability).
If your figures require corrections, you will receive a request to revise the figures according to Production Editors' guidelines.

Thank you for submitting your work to us.

Sincerely,
Daniel E. Barta, Ph.D.

I always fully expect careful and interesting work from these authors, and was not disappointed with this manuscript! Despite the fact that the material detailed in this manuscript has sort-of been documented previously, the newly recognized features definitely warrant publication, and I appreciate the opportunity to review the paper! All my comments are relatively minor and easily accommodated should the authors choose to do so. The only aspect of the manuscript that puzzled me a bit was a peculiar over-division into many paragraphs; I have tried to recommend (in the attached marked-up PDF) where those can be more consolidated. _Brachiosaurus_ continues to be simultaneously enigmatic and fascinating; this is a great contribution to the comprehension of this important sauropod dinosaur.

This work shows a good compilation of old works, but it could go further: a good idea would be to put, within the supplementary material, a similar study within Neosauropoda, in order to compare results and see if it is something typical of this entire clade.

The authors have provided novel data/interpretations and a synthesis of pneumatic features in the ribs of sauropod dinosaurs. Such observations typically reside in the description of new taxa--and thus, the comparative utility of those lone observations is minimal. Here, the authors have taken a focused approach (just dorsal ribs) to highlight pneumatic features across a range of taxa (with a detailed description in Brachiosaurus). This alone is a novel approach...and I suspect that similar follow-up contributions would benefit the field.

I have made many suggestions to the appended manuscript (using track changes).

Feel free to reach out with any questions and nice work on the paper.
