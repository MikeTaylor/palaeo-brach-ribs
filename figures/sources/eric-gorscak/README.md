Subject: Pneumatic "webbing" in dorsal ribs of Rukwatitan Inbox

Dear Eric Gorscak,

Looking over your 2014 paper describing Rukwatitan, I notice that you describe a "capitulotubercular web" of a dorsal rib, and illustrate it in figure  8B. But this being the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the illustration is small and monochrome. I wonder if you have better photos of this feature that you'd be willing to share? (Or whether such photos have been published in a subsequent paper that I missed.)

I checked the otherwise rather good set of Rukwatitan photos on Morphobank — https://morphobank.org/index.php/Projects/Media/result_view/thumbnails/project_id/1258 — but I couldn't find any of the rib.)

Many thanks,

Hi Mike & Matt,

No problem, see attached. It's the only photo I have of it, unfortunately, but you can see some ridges and sediment filled holes between them (I think Pat was the one who coined "webbing" when we were writing the manuscript). The two preserved proximal ribs of Rukwatitan are in the paper, otherwise, the rib elements are mostly shafts. 

If you guys are curious, I have some "Malawisaurus" proximal rib pics too.

Best,
Eric

P.S. Matt, remember your SVPOW post about the missing Malawisaurus cervical? It does indeed exist.

Ah, I think I get it now — are we talking about the subparallel fine lines running north-northwest to to south-southeast and curving slightly to the east as they go?

If that's right, then it reminds me somewhat of the "wrinkled" on the CPOL of the Xenoposeidon vertebrae, discussed and illustrated at
https://svpow.com/2009/02/17/xenoposeidon-week-day-8-somewhat-belatedly-those-wrinkles/

May I please have your permission to use this photo in a composite illustration in a forthcoming paper?

And if I could use your Malawisaurus photos too, that would also be very welcome.

Thanks!

-- Mike.

Yup! Those are the lines! Little tricky to see outright due to the lighting. As for inclusion in the composite, let me check with Pat for permission. 

For Malawisaurus, yeah, I'll send those to you to check out later this week. Some of the ribs have not been published, including one or two that have a similar "webbing", otherwise, have the foramen seen in Gomani, 2005. 

Best,
Eric

Thanks, Eric, much appreciated.

If you prefer not to send previously unpublished photos of Malawisaurus, that's fine; it would be a real win for me just to get the full version of the ones that were published, postage-stamp sized, in Palaeontologia Electronica.

 Hi Mike, 

    Rukwatitan rib: Pat ok'd, go ahead and include the RukwaRib pic for your figure!
    Attached is a zipped folder of some Malawi ribs.
        MAL 282-1 & MAL 282-2 were published in Gomani, 2005. I have both full pics of the ribs and close-ups of the foramina. 
            Gomani attributed these to Malawisaurus, but if you are familiar with my past SVP abstracts, the Malawi sauropods are a bit of a mess that I'm slowly cleaning up. 
        90-83 is not published, but it exhibits the "webbing" condition. This is mostly for your curiosity, as the collected Malawi ribs either have these webbings, foramen, or absent features.

Let me know if you have any other questions. 

Best,
Eric
