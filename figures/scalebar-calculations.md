# Overview

All scalebars have width equal to 0.01 * the width of the image



# Figure 2 (Rib A)

Scalebar width is 0.01 * 4236 = 42.36 pixels


## Part A

Width across across capitulum and tuberculum is 53 cm
That's 1678 pixels
So 1678/53 = 31.66 pixels per cm
So 50 cm scalebar is 31.66 * 50 = 1583 pixels


## Part B

Width across tuberculum in Part A is 531 pixels
                        in Part B is 1211 pixels
So Part B scale is 1211/531 = 2.28 times as big
So there are 31.66 * 2.28 = 72.1848 pixels per cm
So 10 cm scalebar is 72.1848 * 10 = 722 pixels


## Part C

Length of opening is 49 mm
That's 1243 pixels
So 1243/49 = 25.37 pixels per mm
So 5 cm scalebar is 25.37 * 50 = 1269 pixels



# Figure 3 (Rib B)

Scalebar width is 0.01 * 3614 = 36.14 pixels


## Part A

Width across the capitulum and tuberculum is 56 cm
That's 3446 pixels
So 3446/56 = 61.54 pixels per cm
So 20 cm scalebar is 61.54 * 20 = 1231 pixels


## Parts B and C

Length of opening is 12 mm
That's 1523 pixels
So 1523/120= = 126.9 pixels per mm
So 10 cm scalebar is 126.9 * 10 = 1269 pixels
